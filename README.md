# Image Processing Filters using NumPy and OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements custom image processing filters using **NumPy** and **OpenCV**. The filters include:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts a color image into a grayscale image by applying a weighted sum to the RGB values.
- **Blurring**: Applies a simple averaging convolution to smooth the image.
- **Edge Detection**: Uses the Sobel operator to detect edges in the image, both horizontal and vertical.

The project demonstrates an understanding of matrix operations such as convolution and their applications in image manipulation.

## Features
- Grayscale Conversion
- Image Blurring using Convolution
- Edge Detection using Sobel Filters
- Supports both color and grayscale images

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **NumPy**: For matrix operations and array manipulations.
- **OpenCV**: For image loading and saving.

## Installation

1. First, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python
Then for running the file , 
run "python3 image_filter.py"
